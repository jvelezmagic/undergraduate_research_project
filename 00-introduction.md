# Introduction {#introduction .unnumbered}

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) can be considered one of the most
critical health problems of the century. That is, microorganisms'
ability to grow despite exposure to substances designed to inhibit their
growth or kill them. In April 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO)
published its first global report on AMR surveillance
[@EditorialBoard2014]. Taking out of the darkness a common fear, a
possible post-antibiotic future in which common infections or minor
injuries can kill. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of avoiding
antibiotic action is essential for producing knowledge and developing
strategies that reduce the generation of resistant bacteria.

Bacterial adaptability to hostile environmental conditions can be
explained by different elements, not necessarily exclusive. For
instance, mutational phenomena that allow bacteria to evade the
mechanisms of action of certain antibiotics have been one of the most
studied [@dever1991; @andersson2005]. However, the continuous
technological development has allowed us to explore hypotheses where
phenotypic heterogeneity is considered in detail, allowing us to study
emergent behaviors in isogenic populations [@ackermann2015]. Thus, we
have gone from studying bacterial communities as a whole to studying
them from each of the cells that compose them and their emergent
properties.

Single-cell microfluidics is one of the technologies that has made it
possible to create and maintain the microenvironments necessary for
studying bacteria [@yin2012]. Among the most outstanding utilities of
microfluidics, we can find the engineering of bacterial systems,
microbial ecology, bacterial cell cycle, homeostasis, even cell shape,
and geometry. The latter is one of the characteristics that allow the
study of bacterial filamentation, a phenomenon that occurs when the cell
stops dividing but continues to grow, thus producing elongated cells in
the form of filaments.

Mathematical modeling is among the most common strategies to address the
AMR problem. Mathematical modeling allows to pose real-life problems in
a space filled with mathematical language, solve them, and test their
solutions in a real-life living system [@verschaffel2002]. Therefore,
this approach can also be used to analyze in detail why a particular
biological phenomenon is occurring, how its behavior can be modified,
and, finally, to design specific experiments to determine their accuracy
and usefulness.

This thesis describes and discusses how and why bacterial filamentation
may be a general mechanism for cell survival upon exposure to toxic
agents, such as antibiotics, based on experimental analyses and
mathematical modeling. We divided this thesis into three chapters that
explain the methodologies used and take us one step closer to
understanding filamentation with each chapter.

Chapter \@ref(image-processing) describes the fundamental process to
identify and quantify the properties of each cell over time, for
example, its length, the amount of internal toxin, and the amount of
resistance to the toxin.

Chapter \@ref(experiment-analysis) used the data processed in the
previous chapter to explore bacterial filamentation at the population
and single-cell level. Data exploration allowed us to simultaneously
observe the behavior of filamentation and its properties in
heterogeneous populations. For reference, one population with an
antibiotic resistance gene located on the chromosome and another on
multicopy plasmids.

Finally, in chapter \@ref(model-analysis), we postulated a mathematical
model that considers the relationship of cell surface area and volume to
the uptake of a toxic agent diffusing into the medium. This model
allowed us to specifically evaluate the effect of filamentation in an
environment similar to that observed experimentally. Thus, experiments
and models work together to learn more about a biological phenomenon to
help understand and combat the AMR problem.
